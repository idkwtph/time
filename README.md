# Time
This is basically a project I built to practice my HTML, CSS and Javascript

I got the idea from a website here:
https://selftaught-dev.com/JavaScriptClock

It is a responsive clock that shows what the time is, to the second.
It also shows you the day.

Below you can toggle the time format between 24 Hour time and 12 Hour Time
